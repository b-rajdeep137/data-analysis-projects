# Assign the variables for exercise 1 here:
engine_indicator_light = "red blinking"

# BEFORE running the code, predict what will be printed to the console by the following statements:

if engine_indicator_light == "green": 
  print("engines have started")
elif engine_indicator_light == "green blinking": 
  print("engines are preparing to start")
else:
  print("engines are off")

# I think it will print "engines are off" because the value for engine_indicator_light is "red blinking"
